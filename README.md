# Data Structures

### The Deque

Create a deque data structure as part of the Codefellows Python 401 course.

#### Big 0 Notation
- Initializing a Deque Object is `O(1)`.
- All methods are `0(1)`. Append, append-left, pop, pop-left, peek and peek_left are all constant time. You simply add to the left or the right of deque, pop from the front or back of the deque, or peek to see what value is on the right of left of the deque. These operation require no looping, just simple operations on either end of deque. The size and length methods are also simple functions in constant time.
